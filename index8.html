                                - The best of two worlds: technology and knowledge are outsourced, while the function
                                remains in-house.
                                - We equip, train, and backup our consultants with every piece of knowledge and
                                technologies to process your payroll from inside, acting as an extension of your team,
                                reporting to your office and working closely with the HR department and other business
                                units.
                                <!-- - The in-house consultant will continuously collect, normalize, update, and process the
                                payroll, releasing you of the monthly pressure from time-consuming activities while
                                ensuring deadlines are met, and people are paid timely and accurately.
                                - The consultantâ€™s performance will be closely monitored by Trans Skills, and will be
                                backed up by a dedicated team for technical support and knowledge development. -->
